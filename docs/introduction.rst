Introduction
============

Many database systems have to notion of stored procedures, stored functions, stored routines, and/or stored packages. Some database system vendors distinguish stored procedures and stored functions, some database systems have stored functions only, whilst other database systems have stored packages, and some database systems use the term stored routines to amalgamate both stored procedures and stored functions.

Throughout this documentation we use the term stored procedures in the broadest possible meaning, the concept of a piece (user defined) code in a database that can be invoked from an application (regardless whether this piece of code is actual is procedure, function, or part of a package).
